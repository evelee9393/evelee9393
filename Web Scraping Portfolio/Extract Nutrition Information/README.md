# Extract Nutrition Information Project
## Goal
- Get nutritional information from the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) via Selenium (Webdriver)
- Analyze the extracted nutritional information from the "frozen food category" with pandas
- Drawing inspiration from Singapore, Australia and other countries with visual labels, create a Streamlit dashboard that resembles the Health Score Rating label that uses nutritional information from Taiwan. (Graphs generated with pandas, matplotlib and plotly)

## Tools used
- Web Scraping: Selenium (WebDriver: Switch Tabs, select drop-down menu, WebDriverWait etc.)
- Data Processing and Analysis: pandas
- Data Visualization and Nutritional Label: pandas, matplotlib and plotly to create different graphs, with which you can select the desired food item and see the information on a Streamlit dashboard.
