# Extract Nutrition Information Project
## Goal
- Get nutritional information from the Taiwan Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) via Selenium, Webdriver and Fake User Agent
- Analyze the extracted nutritional information from the "frozen food category"
- Drawing inspiration from Singapore, Australia and other countries with visual labels, hopefully create a propositional label that can be applicable in Taiwan.
